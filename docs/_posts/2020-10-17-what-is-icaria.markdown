title: What is Icaria?
---

Icaria is a game which started with a simple question. How would one actually approach colonizing a new world? How do we get
from landing rovers like Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity on Mars to landing humans who will have to live there for months
at a minimum waiting for a transfer window home?

The answer we came up with is Robot Ants--colonies of robots which are robust through cooperation and redundancy--discovering and
harvesting resources to create the infrastructure for a permanent presence on Mars. From there we started thinking
of how to build a game around the core idea of distributed compute with lots of simple robots which can explore, collect, craft and achieve big goals by working together. We're building a game which borrows heavily from many games in the Survival, Crafting, Colony Builder and Automation
genres but, inspired by one of my favorite GDC Talks, [Subnautica Postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkjY_R7zQsM),
we are choosing our spikes:

- Exploration is the key driver of the game. The world should to be varied and surprising and our primary intrinsic rewards are the tools to see more of it.
- Automation is mandatory for success. We want to minimize micro-management in favor of large-scale distributed and automated solutions.
- Perspective is 3rd person with no player avatar.  As distinct from Minecraft, Factorio and Satisfactory, there is no direct manipulation--everything is done through your robots.
- Tile-based world with a height map. This means no Minecraft-like caves but it also means that, unlike Factorio, topology matters.

The idea quickly left Mars and became "some exoplanet" as we wanted a much wider palette of terrain, resources and
other experiences than would realistic on Mars.  We imagine a future [Project Daedalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Daedalus) exploring an Earth-like planet
with the spectrographic signature of an oxygen atmosphere indicating a high probability of life.  Icaria is the name [Daedalus gave to the island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus)
where buried his son Icarus after escaping from King Minos. The game is not about the launch of Project Daedalus, it is the landing on a planet you know next-to-nothing about after hundreds
of years in space.
